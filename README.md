**Acute Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (AURTI) Prediction and Treatment Suggestions**

**Project Definition**
This project aims to build a robust system for predicting Acute Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (AURTI) and providing evidence-based treatment options. 
By leveraging patient symptoms, medical history, and other clinical inputs, the system offers actionable insights for both diagnosis and management.

**Description**
The project focuses on creating a platform that simplifies the identification and treatment of AURTI. _It incorporates key features such as:_

- **Symptom-Based Disease Prediction:** Utilizing patient-reported symptoms to identify AURTI and its severity.
- **Treatment Option Suggestions:** Offering a tailored list of evidence-based treatment options aligned with clinical guidelines.
- **Explainability:** The system provides clear reasoning behind its predictions and recommendations to ensure transparency.
- **User-Centric Interface:** Designed with healthcare professionals in mind, the platform ensures ease of use and integration into clinical workflows.

**Python Libraries required:**
- pip install Flask
- pip install scikit-learn
- pip install pandas
- pip install medspacy
- pip install joblib
- pip install transformers
